 Step one open Cisco Packet Tracer
Step two drag and drop the static router and and devices like PC
Join them or connect with them with a connection cable or wire
And label them for avoiding confusion
Configure the PC ONE and PC ZERO respectively
For configuring the PC1 and PC2 go to the OR Click to the PC, And then click on Desktop tab -> IP configuration -> Fill it IP address and default gateway.
Do both for both PCS

Configure the routers first go to the OR click the router -> Go to the Fast Ethernet 0/0 - > fill The necessary details IP configuration that includes IPV 4 address subnet mask and turn on the port status on Same for Fast Ethernet 0/1

Do this see conflagration for router another one

Again click on router and then go to the config tab And then go to the Static tab -> Add network mask next hop respectively

Click on Add

For verifying the completion of practical we should pass a message from 1PC to another
this is the steps for static routing;

Got it — you’ve basically written a rough procedure for static routing in Cisco Packet Tracer, but it’s a bit messy and repetitive.
I’ll rewrite it in clear step-by-step format so it’s easier to follow for your journal or practical.

Steps for Static Routing in Cisco Packet Tracer
Step 1 – Open Cisco Packet Tracer
Launch Cisco Packet Tracer on your computer.

Step 2 – Add Devices

Drag and drop the required devices into the workspace:

1 Router

2 PCs (PC0 and PC1)

Use the cable tool to connect them:

PC0 → Router (FastEthernet0/0)

PC1 → Router (FastEthernet0/1)

Use labels to name each device and avoid confusion.

Step 3 – Configure the PCs

Click on PC0 → Go to Desktop tab → Select IP Configuration.

Enter the IP Address and Default Gateway for PC0.

Repeat the same for PC1 with its respective IP Address and Default Gateway

wait u have rewrite it in format:
step 1(heading):
one line instruction
IPv4:
subnet
default gateway

step 2 (heading):
pc0 -> desktop ->> IP config -> static -> 
IPv4:
subnet
default gateway

and other steps for it

Got it ✅
I’ll rewrite your Static Routing Steps in the exact Step Heading → One-Line Instruction → IPv4, Subnet, Default Gateway format you want.

Step 1: Add Devices and Connect
Drag and drop 1 Router and 2 PCs (PC0 & PC1) into the workspace and connect them using copper straight-through cables.

Step 2: Configure PC0
PC0 → Desktop → IP Configuration → Static

IPv4: 192.168.1.2

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1

Step 3: Configure PC1
PC1 → Desktop → IP Configuration → Static

IPv4: 192.168.2.2

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

Default Gateway: 192.168.2.1

Step 4: Configure Router – FastEthernet 0/0
Router → Config → FastEthernet0/0 → On

IPv4: 192.168.1.1

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

Step 5: Configure Router – FastEthernet 0/1
Router → Config → FastEthernet0/1 → On

IPv4: 192.168.2.1

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

Step 6: Add Static Routes in Router
Router → Config → Static → Add

Network: 192.168.1.0 → Mask: 255.255.255.0 → Next Hop: 192.168.2.1

Network: 192.168.2.0 → Mask: 255.255.255.0 → Next Hop: 192.168.1.1

Step 7: Test Connectivity
Use PC0 → Desktop → Command Prompt → ping 192.168.2.2 to check if PC1 responds.

If you want, I can also make a same-format version for 2 routers instead of 1 router. That’s usually how static routing is taught.
Do you want me to make that too?
